Criteria include the remaining grey squirrel density post predator recovery representing the cost of grey squirrel management within and 3km around a reserve, the total core habitat area available for red squirrels as a function of core to edge ratio, and the feasibility of management, which incorporates estimates of landowner willingness derived from past participation in woodland grant schemes and ongoing incentives.

    "text": "Motivation and Relevance\nRed squirrel conservation in northern England depends on volunteer-led schemes and piecemeal funding. Traditional strategies focus on conifer plantations and rely heavily on trapping and shooting, practices that more recently attract public opposition and may exclude landholders who lack access to grants or expertise. The return of pine marten offers a humane, self-sustaining and widely supported alternative control method, but managers need guidance on where predator recovery will most benefit red squirrels and how suppression will interact with landownership patterns.\nThis project was motivated by four questions:\n\nHow will grey squirrel distribution respond to pine marten recovery under different predation efficiencies?\n\nWhere should conservation NGOs prioritise strongholds when balancing grey cost, core habitat area and management feasibility?\n\nHow robust are existing policies like the Lake District Stronghold Complex when predator dynamics change?\n\nHow can a transparent modelling framework build trust with stakeholders and adapt to new ecological data?\n\nBy addressing these questions, the dissertation bridges academic modelling and real‑world conservation. It demonstrates that conservation planning must account for human dimensions such as landowner incentives, grant eligibility and community support; factors often overlooked in purely ecological analyses. The outputs are therefore directly relevant to NGOs aiming to design inclusive, adaptable reserve networks that complement their ongoing conservation work which relies heavily on public support."

    "section": "Methodology and Key Decisions",
    "text": "Methodology and Key Decisions\nThe analysis integrates landscape ecology, geospatial programming and computational decision making:\n\nSuppression modelling: Baseline grey squirrel densities were reduced using three pine marten suppression coefficients derived from field studies. The residual density surface becomes the grey cost criterion in the MCDA.\nHabitat and feasibility mapping: High-resolution land cover and woodland data were reclassified to identify suitable red squirrel habitat patches. To represent management feasibility, I compiled proxies for landowner engagement, including past uptake of woodland creation grants, Countryside Stewardship schemes and Forestry England ownership. Each 100 m grid cell receives a feasibility score from 1 (Low) to 4 (High). This layer ensures that strongholds are not only ecologically suitable but also realistic to manage.\nCluster-based MCDA: A custom greedy algorithm grows clusters of habitat patches from seed sites, scoring each cluster on grey cost, core area and feasibility. By evaluating thousands of candidate strongholds across suppression scenarios, the algorithm reveals the optimal balance between ecological benefits and practical constraints. Unlike ‘black box’ optimisers, the scoring is transparent and allows managers to explore how weighting different criteria would change priorities.\nCorrelation analysis: The influence of each criterion on final scores changes with the level of suppression. At moderate suppression the grey cost carries most weight; at high suppression core area dominates; feasibility remains consistently important but secondary. Understanding these shifts helps NGOs decide when to prioritise habitat expansion versus controlling invasive populations."

    "section": "Results and Findings",
    "text": "Results and Findings\n\nDynamic stronghold selection: The model consistently identifies Whinlatter Forest as the top stronghold under all scenarios. An expanded Greystoke site ranks second under low suppression, while Elterwater emerges as a robust candidate across scenarios. These findings suggest that some Lake District strongholds (e.g. Thirlmere and Whinfell) may offer poor return on investment compared with alternative sites.\nShift from conifers to mixed woodlands: Significant pine marten suppression shifts priority strongholds away from conifer plantations towards broadleaf and mixed woodlands. This challenges current policy that favours conifers and highlights the importance of diverse habitats for red squirrel resilience.\nTrade‑offs evolve with suppression: Correlation analysis shows that when grey squirrels are abundant, reducing grey cost is the primary driver of stronghold scores. As suppression increases and grey densities decline, the value of core habitat area rises, and feasibility becomes more influential. This underscores the need for adaptive management as predator populations recover.\nEmerging opportunities for adaptive management: The model recommends staging investments, expanding stronghold boundaries progressively as pine marten densities grow. For example, Elterwater offers early benefits and can be expanded over time as suppression spreads. Such phased approaches allow NGOs to balance short‑term successes with long‑term resilience while working within funding and staffing constraints."

    "text": "Implications for NGOs\nThe dissertation’s framework follows the most recent best practices for informing invasive species control, reserve design and community-based conservation using computational methods.\n\nEvidence‑led site selection: The prioritisation algorithm provides a ranked list of woodland complexes that account for ecological impact and local feasibility. This helps NGOs target limited resources where they will deliver the greatest conservation benefit and where partnerships with landholders are most promising.\nTransparent and replicable tools: All code is written in Python using openly available libraries, allowing organisations to replicate, audit and customise the analysis. This openness fosters collaboration and trust among stakeholders, addressing concerns about opaque optimisation tools.\nIntegration of human dimensions: By incorporating grant histories, management policies and landowner willingness, the framework reflects the practical challenges faced by NGOs. It encourages planners to engage proactively with communities and to consider how public funding schemes influence conservation opportunities.\nAdaptive management: The results demonstrate that conservation priorities should evolve as pine marten populations grow. NGOs can use the scenario outputs to plan phased investments, monitor predator recovery and adjust strategies as ecological conditions change."

By linking pine marten recovery with a transparent prioritisation tool, it moves beyond theoretical discourse to provide actionable guidance for NGOs. The framework reveals hidden trade‑offs between ecology and feasibility, challenges assumptions about conifer-dominated reserves and proposes adaptive pathways that align with human and ecological realities.\nMost importantly, the project underlines the necessity of pragmatic conservation. Sustainable outcomes depend on partnerships with landowners, volunteers and communities who care about wildlife and livelihoods. This perspective informs my aspirations to contribute meaningfully to conservation NGOs in the UK and beyond."
