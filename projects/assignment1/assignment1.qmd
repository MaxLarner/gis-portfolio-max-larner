### Using Python, GeoPandas and Spatial Indexing for Efficient Border Analysis

---

## Project Overview

This project aimed to identify the shortest international border in the world using Python and GeoPandas, with a strong emphasis on algorithm efficiency and spatial reasoning. The task involved writing a custom script to:

- Detect shared borders between countries
- Measure their geodesic length
- Produce a high-quality map of the shortest result

This project achieved an 83 in a third year GIS module.

## The Challenge

Using a shapefile of country borders, write an efficient algorithm that detects and maps the shortest international border in the world.

Key constraints included:

- Efficient comparison of all country pairs
- Accurate distance measurement (in metres)
- Clear cartographic output

---

## My Approach

- Load world country geometries using GeoPandas  
- Build an R-tree to spatially index all countries by bounding box  
- For each country (A), retrieve spatially close neighbours (B)  
- Skip self- and reverse comparisons  
- Check for a true shared border using `.intersection()`  
- If a shared border exists:  
  - Measure its geodesic length using PyProj's Geod  
  - Track the shortest one found  
- Render a UTM-projected map of the result using Matplotlib  

Each function (such as `find_shortest_border`, `check_border`, and `calculate_length`) was modular, documented, and designed to handle edge cases, including enclaves and missing geometries.

## Key Techniques and Decisions

**R-tree Spatial Indexing**  
Used to reduce the number of geometry comparisons by limiting checks to spatially proximate countries. This greatly increased performance by reducing unnecessary calculations.

**Geodesic Measurement**  
Applied WGS84 geodesic calculations using PyProj's `Geod` class for realistic, curvature-aware border length measurement without needing frequent reprojections.

**CRS Handling**  
Distance calculations were performed in WGS84, while the final map was reprojected to a dynamic UTM zone estimated from the border location to ensure spatial accuracy in rendering.

**Map Design**  
The map included the two countries, their shared border, a legend, north arrow, and scalebar. A buffer limited surrounding features, focusing attention on the result.

## Reflections

The use of R-tree indexing was critical to improving efficiency, reducing the number of geometry comparisons required.  
Geodesic calculations offered globally accurate results without introducing heavy computational overhead.  
Handling of geometry types and careful use of projections ensured both analytical robustness and visual clarity.  
While the dataset’s resolution limited exact precision, the algorithm produced replicable and spatially defensible results.
